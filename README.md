Mini Dictionary App (Built with Flet 📘)
A lightweight, cross-platform application built with Python and the Flet framework for quickly searching and viewing technical and vocabulary definitions.

🌟 Key Features
This application showcases the power of Flet's reactive controls and real-time updates:

Instant Search/Filter: The word list filters dynamically in real-time as you type in the search bar (using the on_change event).

Pure Python UI: The entire user interface, logic, and data handling are built using standard Python—no HTML, CSS, or JavaScript required.

Responsive Layout: The two-panel design (Search/List Sidebar and Definition Panel) uses ft.Row to fill the window space efficiently.

Local Data Source: Uses a Python dictionary as a simple, fast, local data source for words and definitions.
